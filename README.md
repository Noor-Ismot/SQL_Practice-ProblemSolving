|---|---------------|----------------|
| 1 | [problem1.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem1.sql) | This SQL query groups patients by weight ranges of 10 units and counts the number of patients in each group. It uses the FLOOR function to categorize weights and aggregates the results with COUNT, ordering them in descending order by weight group. |  |
| 2 | [problem2.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem2.sql) | This SQL query retrieves patient_id, weight, height, and a boolean isObese value from the patients table. The isObese column is calculated using a CASE statement. |  |
| 3 | [problem3.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem3.sql) | This SQL query retrieves patient_id, first_name, last_name, and attending doctor's specialty for patients diagnosed with 'Epilepsy' and whose attending doctor has the first name 'Lisa'. It joins the patients, admissions, and doctors tables to gather this information. |  |
| 4 | [problem4.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem4.sql) | This SQL query retrieves patient_id and a temporary password for patients who have undergone admissions. The password is constructed from the patient_id, the length of the last_name, and the year of birth_date. |  |
| 5 | [problem5.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem5.sql) | This SQL query calculates admission costs for patients based on insurance status, where even patient_ids have insurance. It assigns 'Yes' or 'No' for insurance status and sums the total admission costs for each group. |  |
| 6 | [problem6.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem6.sql) | This SQL query retrieves the full province names where the number of male patients exceeds the number of female patients. It uses GROUP BY and HAVING clauses to filter provinces based on gender counts. |  |
| 7 | [problem7.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem7.sql) | This SQL query retrieves patient information with multiple filtering conditions. |  |
| 8 | [problem8.sql](https://github.com/Noor-Ismot/SQL_Practice-ProblemSolving/blob/main/Hard/problem8.sql) | CTE and conditional aggregation with CASE statement to count patients |  |
